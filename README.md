Description:

The accompanying files will contain Python libraries demonstrating a sound and basic knowledge of the computing language python. As you move through the files the code will be expected to progresively get more and more complex. The purpose of this repository is to display my abilities and communicate what I can do. No license has been given to this repository because this is strictly to showcase my knowledge of the language Python.
